# Farmers-Questionnaire
Data Analysis Using R and Excel

Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset stored in an Excel file (FARMERS_QUESTIONNAIRE_-Cleaning.xlsx) using R. The R script provided performs data import, exploration, cleaning, and visualization. This guide explains how to set up the environment and execute the analysis.

File Descriptions

FARMERS_QUESTIONNAIRE_-Cleaning.xlsx

Contains the raw data for analysis. Ensure the file is placed in the working directory.

It includes responses from a questionnaire. Replace placeholder column names in the R script with actual column names.

analysis_script.R

The R script to analyze the Excel data. The script includes:

Data import using the readxl package.

Data exploration (head(), summary(), str()).

Cleaning and handling missing data.

Visualization using ggplot2.

README.md (this file)

Provides instructions for setting up the environment and running the analysis.

Prerequisites

Before running the R script, ensure you have:

R installed (download from CRAN).

RStudio (optional but recommended for better coding experience).

Installation Instructions

Install Required R Packages

Open RStudio or your R console and run:

install.packages(c("readxl", "tidyverse", "skimr", "naniar"))

Download Files

Ensure both FARMERS_QUESTIONNAIRE_-Cleaning.xlsx and analysis_script.R are in the same directory.

Running the Script

Open the analysis_script.R file in RStudio or your preferred R environment.

Modify the file_path variable to point to the location of the Excel file:

file_path <- "path/to/FARMERS_QUESTIONNAIRE_-Cleaning.xlsx"

Replace placeholder column names (column_name, category_column) with actual names from the dataset.

Run the script line by line or execute the entire file.

Outputs

Summary Statistics: Key insights about the dataset (mean, median, missing values, etc.).

Visualizations: Saved in your R session (can be exported as needed).

Cleaned Data: The modified dataset is saved as cleaned_data.csv.

Customization

Update column names in the script to match those in your dataset.

Add or modify plots as required for specific analysis needs.

Troubleshooting

Package Errors: Ensure all required packages are installed. Use install.packages("<package_name>") for any missing ones.

File Not Found: Check the file_path variable to ensure it correctly points to the Excel file.

Notes

For further customization or advanced statistical analysis, contact the developer or refer to R documentation.

Feel free to extend the script with additional visualizations or models as needed.
